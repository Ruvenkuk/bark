Let's see what is the difference between the morality of the Torah and the Jews in the generation of the desert, and the generation of the media, when any person against whom an accusation is made is subjected to public humiliation and cannot defend himself in any way. If we do not want to insult the accused, but respect him, we encourage him not to insult us. Perhaps then he will respect us and return to the good path, and so we will be victorious.
There is a story about a king who heard about a man who was a master archer. The king had been looking for a worthy opponent in this matter for many years, and as soon as he heard about that master, he immediately invited him to his palace to arrange public competitions in the presence of his princes and servants.
Naturally, the tsar himself opened the competition, and everyone quickly found out that he was a professional shooting master. Almost all of his bullets hit the target. It was the turn of the opponent, and the first bullet hit the edge of the target, and the second, and the third, and the fourth in exactly the same way ... The princes began to whisper about this loser, saying that even a small child could shoot better.
But the king, who had a keen eye in this matter, noticed something interesting. Although all the bullets did not hit the center of the target, they all stuck in one spot, and this requires great skill, and only an experienced sniper could do this.
